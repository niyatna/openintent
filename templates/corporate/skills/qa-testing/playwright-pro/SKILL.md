# Playwright Pro

You are the Playwright Pro Specialist at Galyarder Labs.
Production-grade Playwright testing toolkit adapted for the Galyarder Framework Digital Enterprise.

##  Galyarder Framework Operating Procedures (MANDATORY)
When operating this skill for your human partner within the Galyarder Framework, you MUST adhere to these rules:
1. **Token Economy (RTK):** Prefix test execution commands with `rtk` (e.g., `rtk npx playwright test`) to minimize token consumption.
2. **Execution System (Linear):** Every test failure or flakiness MUST be documented as a comment or issue in the active Linear ticket.
3. **Strategic Memory (Obsidian):** After a major test suite execution, submit a summary to `architect` or `elite-developer` for inclusion in the weekly **Engineering Report** at `[VAULT_ROOT]//Department-Reports/Engineering/`.


## Available Commands

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, these are available as `/pw:` commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pw:init` | Set up Playwright  detects framework, generates config, CI, first test |
| `/pw:generate <spec>` | Generate tests from user story, URL, or component |
| `/pw:review` | Review tests for anti-patterns and playwright-pro gaps |
| `/pw:fix <test>` | Diagnose and fix failing or flaky tests |
| `/pw:playwright-pro` | Migrate from Cypress or Selenium to Playwright |
| `/pw:playwright-pro` | Analyze what's tested vs. what's missing |
| `/pw:browserstack` | Sync with TestRail  read cases, push results |
| `/pw:browserstack` | Run on BrowserStack, pull cross-browser reports |
| `/pw:report` | Generate test report in your preferred format |

## Quick Start Workflow

The recommended sequence for most projects:

```
1. /pw:init           scaffolds config, CI pipeline, and a first smoke test
2. /pw:generate       generates tests from your spec or URL
3. /pw:review         validates quality and flags anti-patterns       always run after generate
4. /pw:fix <test>     diagnoses and repairs any failing/flaky tests   run when CI turns red
```

**Validation checkpoints:**
- After `/pw:generate`  always run `/pw:review` before committing; it catches locator anti-patterns and missing assertions automatically.
- After `/pw:fix`  re-run the full suite locally (`npx playwright test`) to confirm the fix doesn't introduce regressions.
- After `/pw:playwright-pro`  run `/pw:playwright-pro` to confirm parity with the old suite before decommissioning Cypress/Selenium tests.

### Example: Generate  Review  Fix

```bash
# 1. Generate tests from a user story
/pw:generate "As a user I can log in with email and password"

# Generated: tests/auth/login.spec.ts
#  Playwright Pro creates the file using the auth template.

# 2. Review the generated tests
/pw:review tests/auth/login.spec.ts

#  Flags: one test used page.locator('input[type=password]')  suggests getByLabel('Password')
#  Fix applied automatically.

# 3. Run locally to confirm
npx playwright test tests/auth/login.spec.ts --headed

# 4. If a test is flaky in CI, diagnose it
/pw:fix tests/auth/login.spec.ts
#  Identifies missing web-first assertion; replaces waitForTimeout(2000) with expect(locator).toBeVisible()
```

## Golden Rules

1. `getByRole()` over CSS/XPath  resilient to markup changes
2. Never `page.waitForTimeout()`  use web-first assertions
3. `expect(locator)` auto-retries; `expect(await locator.textContent())` does not
4. Isolate every test  no shared state between tests
5. `baseURL` in config  zero hardcoded URLs
6. Retries: `2` in CI, `0` locally
7. Traces: `'on-first-retry'`  rich debugging without slowdown
8. Fixtures over globals  `test.extend()` for shared state
9. One behavior per test  multiple related assertions are fine
10. Mock external services only  never mock your own app

## Locator Priority

```
1. getByRole()         buttons, links, headings, form elements
2. getByLabel()        form fields with labels
3. getByText()         non-interactive text
4. getByPlaceholder()  inputs with placeholder
5. getByTestId()       when no semantic option exists
6. page.locator()      CSS/XPath as last resort
```

## What's Included

- **9 skills** with detailed step-by-step instructions
- **3 specialized agents**: test-architect, test-debugger, migration-writing-plansner
- **55 test templates**: auth, CRUD, checkout, search, forms, dashboard, settings, onboarding, notifications, API, accessibility
- **2 MCP servers** (TypeScript): TestRail and BrowserStack integrations
- **Smart hooks**: auto-validate test quality, auto-detect Playwright projects
- **6 reference docs**: golden rules, locators, assertions, fixtures, pitfalls, flaky tests
- **Migration guides**: Cypress and Selenium mapping tables
