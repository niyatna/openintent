# Codex Tool Mapping

Skills use Claude Code tool names. When you encounter these in a skill, use your platform equivalent:

| Skill references | Codex equivalent |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `Task` tool (dispatch subagent) | `spawn_agent` (see [Named agent dispatch](#named-agent-dispatch)) |
| Multiple `Task` calls (parallel) | Multiple `spawn_agent` calls |
| Task returns result | `wait_agent` |
| Task completes automatically | `close_agent` to free slot |
| `TodoWrite` (task tracking) | `update_writing-plans` |
| `Skill` tool (invoke a skill) | Skills load natively  just follow the instructions |
| `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` (files) | Use your native file tools |
| `Bash` (run commands) | Use your native shell tools |

## Subagent dispatch requires multi-agent support

Add to your Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

This enables `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, and `close_agent` for skills like `dispatching-parallel-agents` and `writing-writing-planss`.

## Named agent dispatch

Claude Code skills reference named agent types like `galyarder-framework:github-pr-workflow`.
Codex does not have a named agent registry  `spawn_agent` creates generic agents
from built-in roles (`default`, `explorer`, `worker`).

When a skill says to dispatch a named agent type:

1. Find the agent's prompt file (e.g., `agents/github-pr-workflow.md` or the skill's
   local prompt template like `code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md`)
2. Read the prompt content
3. Fill any template placeholders (`{BASE_SHA}`, `{WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED}`, etc.)
4. Spawn a `worker` agent with the filled content as the `message`

| Skill instruction | Codex equivalent |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `Task tool (galyarder-framework:github-pr-workflow)` | `spawn_agent(agent_type="worker", message=...)` with `github-pr-workflow.md` content |
| `Task tool (general-purpose)` with inline prompt | `spawn_agent(message=...)` with the same prompt |

## Cross-platform dispatch rule

Write skills so the workflow is portable:

1. If the host supports named agent dispatch, use the named agent directly.
2. If the host does not support named agents, treat `agents/*.md` as role prompt
   sources and dispatch a native subagent with those instructions.
3. If the skill includes a local prompt template, prefer that template over a
   generic agent file because it already captures task-specific placeholders.

For Codex specifically, this means:
- `agents/*.md` are not a runtime registry
- they are role definitions used to construct `spawn_agent(...)` messages
- the spawned runtime agent is still one of Codex's built-in agent types

This is an adapter layer, not a policy rewrite. Keep the strict workflow and
expectations defined by the framework's agent and skill content intact. The
Codex-specific responsibility is to translate dispatch and tool mechanics into
Codex-native operations without softening the underlying protocol.

### Message framing

The `message` parameter is user-level input, not a system prompt. Structure it
for maximum instruction adherence:

```
Your task is to perform the following. Follow the instructions below exactly.

<agent-instructions>
[filled prompt content from the agent's .md file]
</agent-instructions>

Execute this now. Output ONLY the structured response following the format
specified in the instructions above.
```

- Use task-delegation framing ("Your task is...") rather than persona framing ("You are...")
- Wrap instructions in XML tags  the model treats tagged blocks as authoritative
- End with an explicit execution directive to prevent summarization of the instructions

### When this workaround can be removed

This approach compensates for Codex's plugin system not yet supporting an `agents`
field in `plugin.json`. When `RawPluginManifest` gains an `agents` field, the
plugin can symlink to `agents/` (mirroring the existing `skills/` symlink) and
skills can dispatch named agent types directly.

## Environment Detection

Skills that create worktrees or finish branches should detect their
environment with read-only git commands before proceeding:

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

- `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`  already in a linked worktree (skip creation)
- `BRANCH` empty  detached HEAD (cannot branch/push/PR from sandbox)

See `using-git-worktrees` Step 0 and `elite-developer`
Step 1 for how each skill uses these signals.

## Codex App Finishing

When the sandbox blocks branch/push operations (detached HEAD in an
externally managed worktree), the agent commits all work and informs
the user to use the App's native controls:

- **"Create branch"**  names the branch, then commit/push/PR via App UI
- **"Hand off to local"**  transfers work to the user's local checkout

The agent can still run tests, stage files, and output suggested branch
names, commit messages, and PR descriptions for the user to copy.
